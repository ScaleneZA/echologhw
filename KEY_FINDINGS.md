# Hardware Testing Key Findings

This document tracks important discoveries and limitations found during hardware testing that affect the main firmware implementation.

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Test 1: LED Control (PASSED)
**Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Status:** Complete

**Key Findings:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** XIAO ESP32S3 built-in LED does NOT support PWM/analogWrite()
- ‚úÖ Digital on/off patterns work correctly (digitalWrite)
- ‚úÖ All timing patterns work as expected
- ‚úÖ Morse code error indication works properly

**Impact on Main Firmware:**
- Must update `led_control.cpp` `slowPulse()` function to use digital patterns instead of PWM
- Remove any `analogWrite()` calls for built-in LED
- Use on/off timing patterns for smooth visual effects

**Code Changes Needed:**
```cpp
// Replace this PWM approach:
analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness);

// With this digital approach:
if (millis() - lastToggle > period/2) {
  ledState = !ledState;
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, ledState);
  lastToggle = millis();
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Test 2: Power Management (PARTIAL)
**Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Status:** Issues found

**Key Findings:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUE:** Battery voltage readings are extremely low (0.37V) - indicates wrong pin or circuit issue
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE:** USB detection (GPIO 21) fluctuates but debouncing helps
- ‚úÖ Voltage readings are stable (good ADC performance)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE:** Battery showing 0.0% due to low voltage readings

**Impact on Main Firmware:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Battery voltage circuit/pin needs verification - 0.37V is too low for working device
- Need to implement USB detection debouncing/filtering
- May need to verify correct ADC pin for battery reading
- Voltage divider ratio may be incorrect

**Code Changes Needed:**
```cpp
// Instead of single read:
bool usbConnected = digitalRead(USB_DETECT_PIN) == HIGH;

// Need debounced reading:
bool usbConnected = debouncedUSBRead(USB_DETECT_PIN);
```

### ‚úÖ Test 4: PDM Microphone (PASSED)
**Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Status:** Complete - Working correctly

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **SOLUTION FOUND:** Built-in microphone is PDM, requires Arduino I2S library
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT PINS:** PDM Clock=GPIO42, PDM Data=GPIO41
- ‚úÖ **WORKING CONFIG:** Uses `I2S.setPinsPdmRx(42, 41)` and `I2S_MODE_PDM_RX`
- ‚úÖ **AUDIO CAPTURE:** Successfully reads audio samples with ~1280 DC offset

**Code Changes Needed:**

// Setup:
I2S.setPinsPdmRx(42, 41);  // Clock, Data
if (!I2S.begin(I2S_MODE_PDM_RX, 16000, I2S_DATA_BIT_WIDTH_16BIT, I2S_SLOT_MODE_MONO)) {
  // Handle error
}

// Reading:
int sample = I2S.read();
if (sample != 0 && sample != -1 && sample != 1) {
  // Valid audio sample
}
```

### ‚úÖ Test 5: WAV Recording (PASSED)

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **SOLUTION FOUND:** RMS + Variance range detection works well for PDM microphone
- ‚úÖ **OPTIMAL THRESHOLDS:** RMS=50, Variance Min=5000, Variance Max=100000
- ‚úÖ **VARIANCE RANGE:** Using min/max variance filters both silence and non-voice sounds (cloth rubbing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIBRARY ISSUE:** ZCR (Zero Crossing Rate) unreliable with PDM noise floor
- ‚úÖ **MANUAL CONTROL:** User-adjustable thresholds work better than auto-adaptive for POC

**Voice Detection Algorithm:**
- **RMS Threshold:** 50 (detects sound energy above noise floor)
- **Variance Min:** 5000 (filters out silence/steady tones)  
- **Variance Max:** 100000 (filters out extreme sounds like cloth rubbing)
- **Detection Logic:** `(RMS > 50) && (5000 < Variance < 100000)`

**Impact on Main Firmware:**
- Implement RMS + variance range detection in voice_detection.cpp
- Remove ZCR calculation (unreliable with PDM)
- Use manual thresholds as starting point, may add auto-calibration later
- LED patterns work well for visual feedback during detection

**Code Changes Needed:**
```cpp
// Voice detection logic:
bool rmsCheck = (rms > 50.0);
bool varianceCheck = (variance > 5000.0 && variance < 100000.0);
bool voiceDetected = rmsCheck && varianceCheck;

// Remove ZCR calculation - unreliable with PDM noise
```

**Impact on Main Firmware:**
- Must implement ESP32S3-specific WiFi initialization in wifi_sync.cpp
- Need proper WiFi state cleanup after failed connections

**Code Changes Needed:**
```cpp
// ESP32S3 WiFi Connection Pattern:
WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
WiFi.disconnect();
delay(100);
WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);  // Set mode again before begin
WiFi.begin(SSID, PASSWORD);

// After failed connection - cleanup:
